Set up a virtual machine to work on your project.
Create a folder named "srcs" and place all the files required for the configuration of your project in this folder.
Create a Makefile at the root of your directory. This Makefile should set up your entire application, including building the Docker images using the docker-compose.yml file.
Familiarize yourself with Docker and read documentation related to Docker usage to complete this assignment.
Create Dockerfiles for each service in your project. These Dockerfiles should be called in your docker-compose.yml file using your Makefile.
Build the Docker images of your project yourself. Do not pull ready-made Docker images or use services like DockerHub, except for Alpine/Debian.
Set up the following containers:
A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (installed and configured) without nginx.
A Docker container that contains MariaDB without nginx.
Create a volume for your WordPress database and another volume for your WordPress website files.
Establish a Docker network to connect your containers.
Configure your containers to restart in case of a crash.
Set up two users in your WordPress database, one of them being the administrator. Ensure that the administrator's username does not contain "admin" or "administrator".
Configure your domain name to point to your local IP address. The domain name should be "login.42.fr", where "login" is your own login.
Store environment variables in a .env file located at the root of the srcs directory.
Configure your NGINX container as the entrypoint into your infrastructure via port 443, using the TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 protocol.
